# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    I interpret user needs by gathering the information for project requirements and prioritizing the requested functionality. From there I will develop the product starting with the main and most important functionality. User stories are very helpful with this method, because they prioritize customer requests and provide test cases for specific functions. This makes the development process much more efficient and helps to ensure the accuracy of the end product.
    
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I approach each program by choosing a development method to start with. For example choosing between an agile method vs the waterfall method. After choosing a development method, I can start the process by planning and following the method principles. I hope to incorporate the agile method in my future development work, specifically the scrum team development process. Having an agile teams means efficient development, accurate functionality, and more flexibility in the development process. Using the scrum agile principles, I hope to improve on my team communication skills as well as my development skills. 
  
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development is to communicate effectively, do your job to the best of your abilities, and help the team improve with every sprint. Communicating effectively can include asking for help when needed, or keeping the team up to date on the progress of your assigned task. Doing your part and ensuring that you play your role on the team is necessary for the development and progression of the team. Helping others when you have a change is also a good way of building strong team communication and trust.
